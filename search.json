    "section": "",
    "text": "The Chicago Bears over the last twenty years have been a solid team on the surface. Until whats under the hood is unveiled. What has actually been happening to the Chicago Bears is deeper than just a few years of missing the playoffs, It is having no consistent offense and absolutely zero true superstars.\nThe first concern for the Bears over the last two decades has been the concern over most of the franchise tenure, lackluster quarterback play. To open up the time period, the Bears had a stellar team led by the revamped monsters of the midway on defense. The offense just needed to perform above par to be carried to the promise land. With no true franchise starter at QB, the bears settled on a mixed bag of starter until Rex Grossman was enough to lead them to a superbowl in the 2006 season. The bears lost that superbowl in classic fashion and it was clear why, they needed a franchise quarterback. This would be the last time the Bears make it to the superbowl.\nAfter a few years of not making the playoffs after the championship run, the bears finally got their QB of the future, the greatest Chicago quarterback in history. Jay Cutler.\nJay stuck around for 7 seasons before he headed off to Miami but what he did in his time in Chicago hasn’t been topped by any other windy city quarterback. He put up four 20+ touchdown seasons which for the bears is good. The true test of an actual gunslinger is the yards they are able to put up, Cutler was never able to break the 4,000 mark. Neither has any other Bears QB.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n\nBears &lt;- read.csv(\"Bearsbyyear.csv\")\nallnfl&lt;- read.csv(\"ALLNFL2022.csv\")\nbearsleaders &lt;- read.csv(\"Bearsleaders.csv\")\n\nbearsleaders2 &lt;- bearsleaders |&gt; filter (Pos != \"K\") |&gt; mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Player)) |&gt; mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\+\", \"\", Player))\n\nallnfl2&lt;- allnfl |&gt;\n  rename(\n    RK=X,\n    Tm=X.1,\n    G=X.2,\n    PF=X.3,\n    Yds=X.4,\n    Ply=X.5,\n    YP=X.6,\n    TO=X.7,\n    FL=X.8\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(X.14 != \"Int\") |&gt;\n  filter(Ply != \"34136\") |&gt;\n  filter(TO != \"1.3\")\n \n\nBears2 &lt;- Bears|&gt; \n  rename(\n    Year=X, \n    Lg=X.1, \n    Tm=X.2, \n    W=X.3, \n    L=X.4, \n    T=X.5, \n    Div.Finish=X.6, \n    Playoffs=X.7, \n    PF =Points, \n    PA=Points.1, \n    PD=Points.2, \n    Coaches=X.8) |&gt; \n  filter(Top.Players != \"AV\")  |&gt; \n  mutate(Tm=gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Tm)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Div.Finish=gsub(\"th of 4\", \"\", Div.Finish)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Div.Finish=gsub(\"rd of 4\", \"\", Div.Finish)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Div.Finish=gsub(\"st of 4\", \"\", Div.Finish)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Div.Finish=gsub(\"nd of 4\", \"\", Div.Finish)) |&gt; \n  filter(Year &gt; 2002)\n\n\ndabears &lt;- allnfl2 |&gt; filter(Tm == \"Chicago Bears\")\nvikes &lt;- allnfl2 |&gt; filter(Tm == \"Minnesota Vikings\")\npack &lt;- allnfl2 |&gt; filter(Tm == \"Green Bay Packers\")\nlyins &lt;- allnfl2 |&gt; filter(Tm == \"Detroit Lions\")\n\n\n\nBearsQB &lt;- read_csv(\"BearsQB.csv\") \n\nBearsQB2 &lt;- BearsQB|&gt; mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Player)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"//+\", \"\", Player)) |&gt; filter(Year &gt; 2002) |&gt; filter(Cmp &gt; 100)\n\nJustin &lt;- BearsQB2 |&gt; filter(Player == \"Justin Fields\")\nJay &lt;- BearsQB2 |&gt; filter(Player == \"Jay Cutler\")\nJustin2 &lt;- Justin |&gt; filter(Year == 2023)\nJay2 &lt;- Jay |&gt; filter(Year == 2014)\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=BearsQB2, aes(x=QBR, y=Cmp, size=TD),alpha = .3, color=\"darkgrey\")  + \n  geom_point(data=Justin, aes(x=QBR, y=Cmp, size=TD),alpha = .3, color=\"orange\")  +\n  geom_point(data=Jay, aes(x=QBR, y=Cmp, size=TD),alpha = .3, color=\"darkblue\")  +\n   geom_text_repel(data=Jay2, aes(x=QBR, y=Cmp-.005, label=Player)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=Justin2, aes(x=QBR, y=Cmp-.005, label=Player)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=375.7, color=\"red\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=56.5, color=\"red\") +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 9), name=\"Touchdowns\") +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Quarterback Rating\", \n    y=\"Completions\", \n    title=\" Is Justin Fields the Bears savior?\", \n    subtitle=\"The Bears QB play over the last 20 years has been atrocious.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Denis McGinty\"\n    ) + \n  theme_light()+ \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\")\n    ) +\n  theme(plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter testing out a few other young draft picks the Bears have now landed on Justin Fields, who in his third year isn’t coming close to Cutler’s numbers.\nJustin Fields, who was a top draft pick out of Ohio State, is who alot of bears fans thought would save the franchise. But in 2022, Justin did what Justin does. He threw for 2,242 yard, 17 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. He ran the ball productively but he was the face of a franchise that finished last place in the division, last place in the conference, and last in the entire NFL.\nSince the Bears couldn’t control or move the ball, many fans are angry this is how every rebuild ends up for Chicago. A further step back than they were before. Miles behind teams in their division that they were normally always ahead of.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=allnfl2, aes(x=Yds, y=TO), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_point(data=dabears, aes(x=Yds, y=TO), color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_point(data=vikes, aes(x=Yds, y=TO), color=\"purple\") + \n  geom_point(data=pack, aes(x=Yds, y=TO), color=\"darkgreen\") + \n  geom_point(data=lyins, aes(x=Yds, y=TO), color=\"blue\")  +\n  geom_text_repel(data=dabears, aes(x=Yds, y=TO, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=vikes, aes(x=Yds, y=TO, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=pack, aes(x=Yds, y=TO, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=lyins, aes(x=Yds, y=TO, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=8, color=\"red\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept=18, color=\"red\") +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Total Yards\", \n    y=\"Turnovers\", \n    title=\"Chicago is lagging behind the rest of the North.\", \n    subtitle=\"The Bears offense couldn't hold onto the ball, helping the opposing defense with 1.47 turnovers per game.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Denis McGinty\"\n    )  +\n  theme_light() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\")\n    )  +\n  theme(plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough quarterbacks have been a struggle since the dawn of time for the blue and orange, they haven’t really had any playmakers in the last couple decades either.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The 2022 Chicago White Sox were a disappointment beyond measure. No graphic or news article can ever encompass what south side fans felt. The team led half of the City of Chicago through a roller coaster. Being average is usually a word given to teams who are rebuilding or are a player away from a championship. Not for the White Sox, after a playoff appearance a year prior and a couple new faces from free agency, They were poised for a playoff run. In the worst division in baseball, the team was above .500 at the end of July. One game above .500. Maybe they were getting ready for a playoff run? Maybe they are still rebuilding and were expecting to lose 100 games? Nope. They were so inconsistent throughout the year that even they didn’t know what they were doing. By the end of the year, the White Sox ended with a perfectly even 81-81 record.\nToo many games lost to make the playoffs. Too many games won for a good draft pick. Despite all of the media hype around the White Sox in the previous off season, They simply weren’t prepared and weren’t ready to be anything other than average. The worst thing a team can do to a fan is not have a plan. No plan to win currently and no plan to win in the future. The 3 time world series champion never spends money and never commits to a rebuild. The owner of the Sox, who also owns the bulls, has been bailed out by the greatest basketball player of all time and the greatest playoff push of all time. Nothing more, nothing less. The team’s hitting shows the abyss they find themselves in.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nTeams &lt;- read_csv(\"2022baseball.csv\")\n\nSOX &lt;- Teams |&gt; \n  filter(Tm == \"Chicago White Sox\")\n\navg &lt;- Teams |&gt; \n  filter(Tm == \"League Average\")\n\nPlayoffteams &lt;- c(\"Tampa Bay Rays\", \"Cleveland Guardians\", \"Philadelphia Phillies\", \"St. Louis Cardinals\", \"San Deigo Padres\", \"New York Mets\", \"Los Angeles Dodgers\", \"Atlanta Braves\", \"Seattle Mariners\", \"Toronto Blue Jays\", \"New York Yankees\", \"Houston Astros\")\n\nCleveland &lt;- Teams |&gt; \n  filter(Tm == \"Cleveland Guardians\")\n\nSoxandav &lt;- c(\"League Average\", \"Chicago White Sox\")\n\nSoxandavg &lt;- Teams |&gt; \n  filter(Tm %in% Soxandav)\n\nPlayoffTeams&lt;- Teams |&gt; \n  filter(Tm %in% Playoffteams)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=Teams, aes(x=SLG, y=OBP),color = \"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=SOX, aes(x=SLG, y=OBP),color = \"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=PlayoffTeams, aes(x=SLG, y=OBP),color = \"#3cb371\") +\n geom_point(data=Cleveland, aes(x=SLG, y=OBP),color = \"darkgreen\")+\n  geom_point(data=avg, aes(x=SLG, y=OBP),color = \"#EE4B2B\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=SOX, aes(x=SLG, y=OBP-.005, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=avg, aes(x=SLG+.011, y=OBP, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_encircle(data=Soxandavg, aes(x=SLG, y=OBP), s_shape=0.6, expand=.05, colour=\"black\") +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Slugging Percentage\", \n    y=\"On Base Percentage\", \n    title=\"Sox Swinging in The Middle Ground\", \n    subtitle=\"Chicago's inconsistent batting leaves them in the dust of post season teams.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By Denis McGinty\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\")\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe South Side hitters incorporate everything it meant to be a White Sock on the stat sheet. Completely complacent with being average. Over the previous 6 years before this season, the Sox were ‘rebuilding’ which actually meant sitting there and wasting hall of fame talent. One of if not the only bright spot over that period was Josè Abreu. Abreu showed up every day and did his work for a bottom tier baseball team who had rumors of relocating and honestly should’ve been relegated to AAA ball. If the front office of the Sox knew better, they should’ve swooped him up out of Cuba when he was 16 and taken 6 year old Luis Robert while they were at it. Robert has been a promising young cuban prospect since he was first discovered and has shown his true potential in 2023. But even these two godly players couldn’t hit for power and were perfectly fine with being average in 2022.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\nPlayers22 &lt;- read_csv(\"22Playersbball.csv\")\n\nPlayersclean &lt;- Players22 |&gt; \n  mutate(Name=gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Name)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Name=gsub(\"\\\\#\", \"\", Name)) \n\nSOX22 &lt;- Playersclean |&gt;\n  filter(Tm == \"CHW\")\n\nPlayers22f &lt;- Playersclean |&gt; filter(PA &gt; 125)\n\nMLB &lt;- c(\"CHW\", \"ARI\", \"ATL\", \"BAL\",\"BOS\",\"CHC\", \"CIN\", \"CLE\", \"COL\", \"DET\", \"HOU\", \"KCR\", \"LAA\", \"LAD\", \"MIA\", \"MIL\", \"MIN\", \"NYM\", \"NYY\", \"OAK\", \"PHI\", \"PIT\", \"SDP\", \"SEA\", \"SFG\", \"STL\", \"TBR\", \"TEX\", \"TOR\" )\n\nMLB&lt;- Players22f |&gt;\n  filter(Tm %in% MLB)\n\nMLBlim&lt;- MLB |&gt; \n  filter (H&gt;65, RBI&gt;30)\n\nSoxlim&lt;- SOX22 |&gt;\n  filter (H&gt;65, RBI&gt;30)\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=MLBlim,aes(x=H, y=RBI, size=HR),alpha = .3, color=\"light grey\") + \n   geom_point(data=Soxlim,aes(x=H, y=RBI, size=HR),alpha = .3, color=\"black\") + \n  scale_size(range = c(1, 10), name=\"Home Runs\") +\n    geom_smooth(data=MLBlim, aes(x=H, y=RBI), method=\"lm\", colour= \"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=Soxlim, aes(x=H, y=RBI-.005, label=Name)) +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Hits\", \n    y=\"Runs Batted In\", \n    title=\"The White Sox knock in an average amount\", \n    subtitle=\"The south side sluggers couldn't hit for power which leaves their star players average at best.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By Denis McGinty\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe only other bright spot throughout the year was the pitching. Well not all of them, just Dylan Cease and Liam Hendriks. Hendriks who is now a cancer survivor and advocate, and Cease who was the Cy Young runner-up in 2022 were the only chances the White Sox pitching staff had. But how do you save games for a team that doesn’t win and how can one rely on a starter when they only pitch once every 5 days? Because of this, The White Sox pitching situation was the same as the rest of the team as a whole. Average.\n\n\nCode\nmlbp &lt;- read_csv(\"mlbp.csv\")\n\nmlbpa &lt;- mlbp |&gt; filter (`#P`&lt; 870)\n\nSoxp &lt;- mlbpa |&gt; filter (Tm == \"Chicago White Sox\")\n\nALcentral &lt;- c(\"Kansas City Royals\", \"Cleveland Guardians\", \"Detroit Tigers\", \"Minnesota Twins\")\n\nPlayoffteams &lt;- c(\"Tampa Bay Rays\", \"Cleveland Guardians\", \"Philadelphia Phillies\", \"St. Louis Cardinals\", \"San Deigo Padres\", \"New York Mets\", \"Los Angeles Dodgers\", \"Atlanta Braves\", \"Seattle Mariners\", \"Toronto Blue Jays\", \"New York Yankees\", \"Houston Astros\")\n\nPlayoffs&lt;- mlbpa |&gt; filter(Tm %in% Playoffteams)\n\nALcentralxs &lt;- mlbpa |&gt; filter(Tm %in% ALcentral)\n\navgg &lt;- mlbpa |&gt; filter(Tm == \"League Average\")\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=mlbpa, aes(x=reorder(Tm, -ERA), weight=ERA),fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Soxp, aes(x=reorder(Tm, -ERA), weight=ERA),fill=\"black\") +\n  geom_bar(data=ALcentralxs, aes(x=reorder(Tm, -ERA), weight=ERA),fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Playoffs, aes(x=reorder(Tm, -ERA), weight=ERA),fill=\"#3cb371\") +\n  geom_bar(data=avgg, aes(x=reorder(Tm, -ERA), weight=ERA),fill=\"red\") + \n  coord_flip() + \n  theme_light() +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Teams\", \n    y=\"Earned Run Average (ERA)\", \n    title=\"Chicago's pitching is the mark to beat\", \n    subtitle=\"The Sox pitching staff was carried by Dylan Cease to edge above league average.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By Denis McGinty\"\n    )  + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\")\n    )"
